<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Tasmota v8.1**
**2019-12-25**
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from the Tasmota Development Team.

Tasmota v8.1 Doris is released. See [changelog for all changes](changelog-8.1).

:warning: :warning: :warning:    
This release supports downgrade only to **version 7.2.0.x**. There are major changes in configuration code and layout which will completely break any downgrade to versions prior to v7.2. 

#### **Tasmota v7.2**
**2019-12-21**

Tasmota v7.2 Constance is released. See [changelog for all changes](changelog-7.2).

Breaking change: tasmota-basic.bin is renamed to **tasmota-lite.bin**. Update your OtaUrl accordingly.

:warning: :warning: :warning:    
This will be the only release that supports fallback from future **release 8.0 and development versions 7.2.0.x** which will be released shortly. Tasmota v8.0 will have major changes in configuration code and layout which will completely break any downgrade to versions below v7.2. 

#### **5 MILLION**
**2019-12-11**

Tasmota has hit **5 MILLION DOWNLOADS** from GitHub!!! 

We would like to thank everyone for making this project better with each new release. 

Onwards to 10 million and beyond!

#### **Tasmotizer!**
**2019-12-04**

Remember that official Tasmota firmware flashing tool from a month ago? Pfft, old news! 

We present to you the even more official, completely home made and GMO free: **TASMOTIZER!**

[<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11555742/69891714-ec14ca00-12fe-11ea-9140-92842fa1bff9.jpg" width=300></img>](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer) 

It downloads the latest release/development firmware for you, backs up the original firmware with one-click and can even (if you wish so) send your default settings to the device after it's flashed. But most of all it has a dark theme, so it must be good!

#### **Tasmota v7.1.1**
**2019-11-29**

Tasmota v7.1.1 [Betty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iEoq8qZZK8) is released. Read [Moving to v7](moving-to-v7) on all the breaking changes and how to deal with them.

This release is chock full of changes and improvements! 
* Everything is Tasmota now, Sonoff-Tasmota is no more.
* WebUI went to the dark side but managed to pick up colorpicker powers on the way. 
* Default and only supported Arduino cores are >2.6.
* Expanded [TuyaMCU](TuyaMCU) support with new commands.
* Better [I2C device](I2CDevices) address management.
