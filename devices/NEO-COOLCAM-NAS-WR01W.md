I got NEO and managed install tasmota on it.

**IMPORTANT: **I checked PCB and it is not solid for long use and high power. All contact are very cheap, also there is no POW.

I can recommend user other SmartPlug AISIRER, AVATAR (see on tasmota main page), 2 euro difference, but much more solid + onboard POW.

All details are into Espurna page
