**This feature is included only in tasmota-sensors.bin** 

Otherwise you must [compile your build](compile-your-build). Add the following to `user_config_override.h`:
```
#ifndef USE_BME680
#define USE_BME680          // Enable support for BME680 sensor using Bosch BME680 library (+4k code)
#endif
```
----
BME680 sensor, an environmental I<sup>2</sup>C sensor with temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and gas.

_The BME680 takes those sensors to the next step in that it contains a small MOX sensor. The heated metal oxide **changes resistance** based on the volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air, so it can be used to detect gasses & alcohols such as Ethanol, Alcohol and Carbon Monoxide, and perform air quality measurements. Note it will give you one resistance value, with overall VOC content, but it cannot differentiate gasses or alcohols._

See [BME680 - Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Gas Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660) for more information.


## Configuration

#### Wiring
| BME680   | ESP8266 |
|---|---|
|GND   |GND   
|VCC   |3.3V   
|SDA   |GPIOx 
|SCL   |GPIOy

#### Tasmota Settings 
In the _Configuration -> Configure Module_ page assign:
- GPIOx to `I2C SDA (6)`   
- GPIOy to `I2C SCL (5)`

After a reboot the driver will detect BME680 automatically and display temperature, humidity, pressure and gas resistance measured.

Sensor sends a  `tele/%topic%/SENSOR` JSON reponse:

```json
{
  "Time": "2019-11-03T21:25:53",
  "BME680": {
    "Temperature": 27.7,
    "Humidity": 65.2,
    "Pressure": 989,
    "Gas": 346.24
  },
  "PressureUnit": "hPa",
  "TempUnit": "C"
}
```
### Commands
[`TempOffset`](Commands#tempoffset) can be used for calibrating the measured temperature. This setting affects **all** temperature sensors on the device.
