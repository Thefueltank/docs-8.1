[RDM6300](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/RDM6300) 125KHz cardreader mini-module is designed for reading code from 125KHz card compatible read-only tags and read/write card.

## Configuration
Sensor uses serial interface for communication.

#### Wiring
| RDM6300   | ESP8266 |
|---|---|
|TX   |GPIOx 
|RX   |GPIOy
|Pin3      | unused
|GND   |GND   
|VCC   |5V   


#### Tasmota Settings 
In the _Configuration -> Configure Module_ page assign:
1. GPIOx to `SerBr Tx (71)`
2. GPIOy to `SerBr Rx (72)`

If the RFID Tag is held in front of the Antenna the reader starts sending the Tag ID. The Tag Id is prefaced with a 0x02 and the end is delimited with a 0x03. If the reader reads the tag multiple times you would get one line with multiple times the Tag ID. For this to seperate you can add a SerialDelimiter of 0x03. This will split the result from the serial into serveral single mqtt messages. But (probably) all the messages wil be prepended with a binary 0x02.

Set [SerialDelimiter](Commands#serialdelimiter) to 3
```
SerialDelimiter 3
```

### OpenHab
