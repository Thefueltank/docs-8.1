# NRF24l01(+)
  
This chip is manufactured by Nordic Semiconductors as a single chip transceiver in the 2,4 GHz band. 

## NRF24L01(+) and Bluetooth  

There are many applications in wireless consumer products and the chip is well-known in many Arduino-projects as a versatile low-cost-module.  
In recent years solutions were found to use this chip for limited Bluetooth-Low-Energy communication.  
One of the first articles about this topic can be found here:

Several further work was done later on by different developers and a working bridge to read sensor data from a XIAOMI MJ_HT_V1 already exists.
The fundamental principle is, that some of these sensors send its data as a usual BLE-advertisement packet with a proprietary data format at the end of the payload. These packets had to fit into the 32 bytes of the FIFO-RX-buffer of the NRF24L01, otherwise the "later" bytes were lost.  

For the Tasmota-driver a new solution was found. 
The basic idea is to use some constant ID-bytes of the BLE-packets as the PDU-type for the NRF24l01. 
Thus, all bytes before these ID-bytes are lost and the size restriction for the payload is successfully circumvented. 
That way it is possible to read the sensor data from a Mi Flora sensor, which is positioned outside of the 32-byte-range.
Of course there is still no bidirectional "real" BLE-communication, only advertisements can be read.

## USAGE:
Uncomment #USE_SPI, #USE_NRF24 and #USE_MIBLE in 'my_user_config.h' and configure the pins vor SPI_DC and SPI_CS while connecting the hardware SPI pins 12 - 14(MOSI, MISO and CLOCK).  
!! ⚠️ In order to simplify the code, the pin names from the SPI-display-drivers are used ⚠️ !!   
For the NRF24L01 SPI_DC translates to CSN and SPI_CS to CE.

No additional steps are necessary.  
The initial log should like this:  
  
```  
00:00:00 NRF24L01 initialized  
00:00:00 NRF24L01+ detected  
00:00:00 MIBLE: started  
```
